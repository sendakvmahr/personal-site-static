            <p>3 Months in!</p>
<p>I'd say a lot of the core mechanics of being able to move, sell, merge, and expire items are functional - though they could use a lot of tweaking and cleaning. Movement doesn't have to be fighting-game nice, but it shouldn't feel annoying (even if moving freight maybe should feel a bit clunky.)</p>
<p>Next steps are refactoring and... NPC complexity!! I've been hella excited for this. I generally want NPCs to do... more in games. I played a decent amount of pre-Stardew Valley farming sim, so I probably have high standards.</p>
<p>I got to do a little editor while brushing up on React because I need to. Decided to do this after being utterly incompetent at writing my own placeholder dialogue because I can't remember my own tags/item names.</p>

<p>I did manage to upload the game on itch this month. Then I hid it behind a password. 3/5 of the areas having music, while the other two were quiet, didn't feel right. It wasn't supposed to even have music, but it felt more unfinished that way.</p>
<p>Speaking of dialogue, cutscene engines are not fun. I imagined something like RPGmaker's system since that's what I started learning gamedev on. But... actually doing that myself took a lot of time. Enough that only one cutscene made it in this month, and I'm going to toss most of it due to other characters developing.</p>
<p>Lastly, I've gotten all the assets down in the game to a nice palette of colors. Went from 143 to 88 colors! I do not think anybody will notice but me, but it makes me very happy. I wish I took pics of the color differences, but I was somewhat interrupted with getting off instagram and onto cara.</p>
