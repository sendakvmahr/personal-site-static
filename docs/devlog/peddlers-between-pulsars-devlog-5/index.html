            <p>Oh my, 22 days late on this one. It will be short - I have a lot to learn about work/time estimates.</p>
<ol>
<li>Music has taken the bulk of my concentration time - time slots where I can sit and really get into what I'm doing. It took about 3 sessions to get a song done, on 3 good days. So... there go a lot of things I was planning to do that didn't really get done.</li>
<li>Godot's new tilesystem is great! But all my maps are a bit broken now. That is taking a bit of time to redo.</li>
<li>I've made ONE song that I don't get sick listening to. Which I'm happy to celebrate over, considering I could barely put notes in FL studio a when I started.</li>
<li>Lots of little sprite updates. It's nice seeing the placeholder art go away.</li>
</ol>
