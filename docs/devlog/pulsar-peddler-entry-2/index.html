            <p>It doesn't feel like a month has passed.</p>
<p>No more Space Plants - It's Pulsar Peddler now.</p>
<p>A lot of the system is running on really rough item images. But the actual planting part made it in!

<p>Cutscenes also made it in. I expected cutscenes to be a lot simpler than they were. I made a little list of dialogues to show and actions to take, similar to what RPG Maker does, ran them all, and completely forgot that games were designed to be asynchronous. On my first attempt, everything happened at roughly the same time - all the animations played, all the dialogue got queued, and collision triggers were enabled and disabled before anyone could say anything. It ended up working though, and that's how this little fellow walked up to the its plant friend before the dialog started.</p>

<p>That plant is also named Ajurhang - the first major NPC planned has shown up!</p>
<p>One thing that is clear - I'm going to need a lot more time dedicated to cleaning the GUI.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog_images/information_density.webp" alt="screenshot of a text-based game next to the non-text based version" /></p>
<p>I spent a decent amount of time on that in the HTML prototype, but translating it into the pixel game much higher information density. Not only is the text bigger, the screen and resolution are smaller. A lot of the major stuff is conveyed, but there's still information missing in the pixel version:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where the ship is</li>
<li>Item stats</li>
<li>Item description</li>
<li>Prices per planet</li>
</ul>
<p>Asset wise, have been trying to learn to compose. Something finally popped out of FL Studio that actually sounded appropriate for its use. It's not amazing, but I'm relieved that I'll be able to make my own soundtrack as well.</p>
<p>TLDR:</p>
<ul>
<li>Items and item combinations in</li>
<li>NPCs/Cutscene bases in</li>
<li>GUI Improvement with more work needed</li>
<li>A song!!!</li>
</ul>
