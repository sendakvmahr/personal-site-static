            <p>Not as much done as usual - I took 2 weeks off work and gamedev for a vacation. Spent lots of time baking in the sun, away from the computer screen.</p>
<p>Most of the changes were graphics and code organization. I'll talk about the graphics first.</p>
<h2>Animations</h2>
<p>All the walk and idle anims and characters are done. All 5 here! wiggling around. Except the human. They're not very wiggly.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tararntula.com/build/assets/blog_images/idle-anims-display.gif" alt="A human watches as a gas, beetle, mollusk, and plant with idle animations" /></p>
<p>I'm particularly fond of this one's (Gitrah's) little walk. It's not as lurchy as I'd like it, but if I made it more jerky, they'd feel too awkward to play.</p>

<h2>Interface</h2>
<p>The text was awful before, and I knew that. I was using a font that wasn't monospaced onto a PNG, and told Godot to render it as a monospaced font. So I cleaned up the menus a bit and made it a proper font - but with some characters modified to be subscripts instead.</p>
<p>Also, name tags and a nicer text box. But not a nicer ship, yet.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tararntula.com/build/assets/blog_images/text_update_screenshot.webp" alt="There is a plant talking to a gas alien in a pink alpine area. The text box is labeled &quot;Neon&quot; and says &quot;Someone is looking for some C12H22O11 - that compound specifically. They were upset with the C70 I gave them.&quot; There is an placeholder ship image in the map." /></p>
<h2>Code Refactoring</h2>
<p>NPCs and cutscenes needed work - I want them to vary depending on the player character. Not just a few different lines - each character should see different parts of the events depending on who they're playing as. Unplayed characters should show up as NPCs in the world - but not if you're playing as them, and have all the custom animations they have as players.</p>
<p>Cutscenes are still a mess. But they're in a much better position to start handling playing the same scene from the different perspective of the 5 player characters.</p>
<p>NPC Players sounds simple, but Godot is the first time I've worked in a language without multiple inheritance (and noticed). So no smashing the NPC and Player objects together, had to rethink my structure a bit and clean things up.</p>
