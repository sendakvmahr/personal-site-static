            <p>I really wanted this to be a boring month.</p>
<p>Then I could focus on all the messing around in FL Studio I did. About how &quot;oooh I found the help text and WOW THIS IS WHAT THEY MEAN BY MASTERING AND PRODUCTION AND oops I made it sound worse.&quot; Maybe a bit about how I'm kind of figuring out how I think and about making songs and sounds.</p>
<p>But no, I think what's on my mind is how I want the tone of Peddlers between Pulsars to go now.</p>
<p>Art style wise, I know it looks like an asset pack some silly cozy game. Gameplay wise, I didn't want it to be much harder, nor contain any violence. But I wasn't 100% sure where I wanted to take the tone of the story and writing.</p>
<p>Originally, the protoype felt WAY lonelier than it is now. To sum up the original mood in a screenshot:
<img src="https://www.tararntula.com/build/assets/blog_images/text_pic.jpg" alt="You get ready to enter cryosleep.I say goodnight, to nobody in particular." />
(You're the only one on your ship.)</p>
<p>That was a bit depressing when it was in text format and the world was plain black on grey. But when the players got sprites, that just got way more depressing. So I when I wrote non-cutscene text for the godot version, I went for lighter and goofier, which I wanted to pull off in the text version but had trouble doing so.</p>
<p>There were still some conflicts, which surfaced when I did a concept doodle for the inter-pulsar travel menu weeks ago:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tararntula.com/build/assets/blog_images/nav_menu.png" alt="WIP image of a navigation map with 2 galaxies colliding" /></p>
<p>and I thought &quot;this is exactly how I want the world in my game to <em>feel.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>The worldbuilding has gone all out in that direction. I defined Peddlers in this world as a unfun job with fairly high requirements. It's not something most would get into if they didn't have strong motivation for doing so, and a lot of those motivations were strong because they came from serious issues.</p>
<p>I've been hesitant about making that the player experience that heavy though. Writing that seriously also means getting in that serious and slightly helpless of a headspace, which... I wasn't sure I wanted to do.</p>
<p>Well! I can't see myself getting OUT of that headspace the next four years! Decision made for me!</p>
<p>I'm not changing the art direction, though. I'm a fan of &quot;looks cute, sounds happy, lyrics/context is the total opposite.&quot; I do think there will be moments where I want the contrast to be that notable as well.</p>
