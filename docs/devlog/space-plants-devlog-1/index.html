            <p>Well! First devlog! It's for a game that's only been in progress a few months, and the working title (Space Plants, for when I inevitably fix the title for SEO purposes) is already out of date.</p>
<p>Originally, I just wanted a game where hydroponics' actual strengths shine. A small, cramped space but with access to water, or the ability to recycle it. Hydro can be very low energy if you don't need lighting. Like if you were close to a star with no clouds or atmosphere to blot it out. So Space Plants sounded like a better name than &quot;unnamed something game.&quot;</p>
<p>The last few games I worked on in college were with Cocos2D, Unity, or plain Javascript. Wasn't really a fan of how any of those handled pixel art, so picked up Godot and Aseprite and got to work.</p>
<p>Then, I found an amazing feature had been added to Aseprite while I was away - tilemap layers.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog_images/1-1.webp" alt="Mollusk in a pink alpine area with petrified wood" /></p>
<p>I love working on tilesets, and tilemap layers made it so much easier and faster. I have been a bit too indulgent recently, and I've gotten more tileset drawing done than in-game mechanics...</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to developing this tileset further in particular.</p>

<p>I'm a sucker for harsh, directional lighting and brutalism. Especially eco-brutalism, which this will eventually be. I'm also finding lighting like this isn't really done in tilesets because it is blowing up the number of tiles I need, but... it's so cool!</p>
<p>But hopefully next month, there will be actual plants.</p>
